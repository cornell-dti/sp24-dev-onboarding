Some fun facts about me: 
1. I'm a big combat sports fan. My favorite boxer is Naoya Inoue and my favorite MMA fighter is Max Holloway.
2. I also watch a lot of soccer and am a big Arsenal and Real Madrid fan, though I mainly support the former.
3. I am a caffeine addict. I used to drink a lot of coffee but found the crash too much to deal with and now mainly drink tea.
