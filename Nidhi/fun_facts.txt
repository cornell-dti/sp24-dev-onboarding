1. I have a little collection of rubber ducks and I hope to get more(and I was born on national rubber duck day!)
2. I like to doodle a lot - I also sometimes do digital art for fun
3. I enjoy going to random buildings on campus, and my current favorite indoor spot is a corner where Rhodes and Upson connect.
